## Overview
This is a Project Tango port of the basic Unity 3D Roll Ball game. 

## Motivation
Built to learn how to use pose data provided by Project Tango tablet. This data include position and rotation. This project uses the position to manipulate the ball and the rotation to move the camera into a perspective where the player feels the ball will move forwards when they walk fowards.
